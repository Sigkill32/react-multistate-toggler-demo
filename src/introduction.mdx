# Features

- Highly customizable: Control the look and feel of the toggler switch with more than 10 customizable options.
- Multiple states: create switches with 3 states in addition to traditional two state switches.

# Motivation

The existing libraries let you create toggle switches with only 2 states. This library gives its users the freedom to change choose between a two and a three state toggle switch.
