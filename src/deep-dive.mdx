## Multiple states of the toggle switch

The library allows you to create toggle switches with 3 states as well as 2 states.

**Toggle switch with 2 states**

- The toggle button with 2 states toggles between two boolean states: `true` and `false`.
- The `onChange` function in this case returns either true or false on every change in state.
- You may pass either true or false as `initState` value.
- `buttonStates` by default is set to 2.
- Length of `togglerTheme` in this case will be 2.

Please refer the example section to get better insights.

**Toggle switch with 3 states**

- The button in this case toggles between 3 states which are internally represented by integers 1, 2 and 3.
- The `onChange` function in this case returns either 1, 2 or 3 on every change in state.
- You may pass 1, 2 or 3 as `initState` value.
- `buttonStates` should be set to 3 to activate toggle switch with 3 states.
- Length of `togglerTheme` in this case will be 3.

## The `onChange` function

`onChange` is a callback function that is invoked after each state change. This callback is returned with an argument that contains points to the current state of the switch.

**Usage**

```jsx
export default class App extends Component {
  state = {
    toggleState: 1
  };

  handleChange = toggleState => {
    this.setState({ toggleState });
  };

  getGender = () => {
    const { toggleState } = this.state;
    const genders = ['Female', 'Male', 'Trans'];
    return genders[toggleState - 1];
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Choose your gender <span>{this.getGender()}</span></p>
        <ToggleButton
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          initState={3}
          ....
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Taking control of the button's look and feel

Take control of your button's look by using `buttonDesign` prop. It takes either `rounded`, `angled` or `custom` as values. Please refer example section to understand how `rounded` and `angled` buttons look like.
by passing the `custom` to `buttonDesign` prop you can control the radius of the knob and the container using `buttonRadius` prop.

## Stretching the knob

Knob width can be set using `togglerWidth` prop. The library will automatically handle container width to fit the knob in it.

## The `overrideInternalStyles` option

`overrideInternalStyles` option lets you take full control of the look and feel of toggle switch. By setting `classNames` prop with desired classNames and by setting `overrideInternalStyles` to `false` will reset internal styles and let you define style the switch with classNames that you've defined.
